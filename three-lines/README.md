## Key Concepts
 - Problem topics: Geometry
 - Data types and data structures: 2-d array(pair), Map
 - Problem-solving strategies: Brute-Force, Sorting


## Run Time
The running time of this program is O(N).
We analyze if the given data set fulfill the four conditions that will form three lines
by iterating the whole array four times. 
The run time is 4*O(N) = O(N).
