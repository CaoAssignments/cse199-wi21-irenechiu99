## Key Concepts
 - Problem topics: Geometry
 - Data types and data structures: 2-d array(pair), Map
 - Problem-solving strategies: Brute-Force, Sorting


## Run Time
The run time of this program is O(N).
We check if the given data set fulfill the four conditions that will form three lines on a graph
by iterating the whole array for four times. 
The run time is 4*O(N) = O(N).
