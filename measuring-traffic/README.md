## Key Concepts
 - Problem topics: Intervals
 - Data types and data structures: 1-d array
 - Problem-solving strategies: Dynamic-Programming


## Run Time
The run time of this program is easy to analyze.
We iterate through the vector which contains N numbr of element twice. 
Hence, the total run time is 2 * O(N), which leads to O(N).
