## Key Concepts
 - Data Structure: Array/Vector
 - Algorithm: Range/Interval Arithmetic Operation

## Idea


## Run Time
The run time of this program is straight forward. 
We iterate through the vector which contains N numbr of element twice. 
Hence, the total run time is 2 * O(N) which leads to O(N).
