## Key Concepts
 - Data Structure: Array/Vector
 - Algorithm: Sort/Swap

## Idea



## Run Time
The run time complexity of this program is O(1). 

A swap function leads to O(1) constant running time.
We will do swaps to the maximum number of three times, which leads to 3*O(1).
When calculating the answer by doing arithmetic operation on some constant integer, we get O(1) constant run time, too.
